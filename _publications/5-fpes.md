title: "Design and development of faculty performance evaluation system (FPES) v2.0"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/fpes
excerpt: 'One of the essential ingredients in establishing trust in academic institutions among its stakeholders is the quality of its learning providers. Hence, it is imperative to continually adapt innovations to improve educators’ evaluation process and deliver a reliable result for data-driven decision-making. This study focused on enhancing the existing faculty performance evaluation system (FPES) for the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) following the RUP’s Iterative Model as its system development methodology (SDM). A total of 75 respondents were identified using specific sampling techniques according to the respondent type. The participants’ responses from the unstructured interview and survey were the basis of the upgrade, uncovering the current status of the FPES version 1.0 (FPES v1.0) and its level of acceptability according to the ISO 9126 Software Quality Metrics. Using the same indicators, respondents evaluated the proposed FPES version 2.0 (FPES v2.0) and employed Chi-Square Statistics and Cramer’s Rule to compare the performance of both systems. Findings revealed an overall rating of 4.0025 Likert Score for the FPES v1.0, indicating its acceptability in terms of functionality, reliability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability. However, a significant improvement in the overall rating for the FPES v2.0 with a 4.53 Likert Score justifying the system as strongly acceptable. The results signify that the enhancement of the faculty performance evaluation system (FPES v2.0) manifested a positive impact in the institution’s faculty performance evaluation process, thus a favorable alternative to the existing system. Nonetheless, carrying out the recommendations, particularly enhancing the system’s functionalities as needed over time, will ensure the sustainable use of the system.'
