title: "Integration of RESTFul API to Student Information System for Secured Data Sharing and Single Sign-on"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/restapi
excerpt: 'Growth in the usage of REST APIs has been witnessed in recent years. Many businesses and companies, such as social media sites and online services, used API to interoperate with other benefits. REST was considered the most logical, efficient, and widespread standard in the creation of APIs. Hence, the main focus of the study is to develop a Web-Based Student Information RESTful API. This paper utilized the incremental model in the development of the system. A survey was used to validate the problems encountered in acquiring student information and determine the software quality based on ISO 9126 software quality metrics. Survey questionnaires were distributed to the system developers as the study respondents following the total population sampling technique. A five-point Likert scale was used to quantify the survey result and weighted mean to analyze and interpret the result. Based on the analysis and interpretation, the system developers recognized that the system is Acceptable with an average weighted mean of 4.44. This study also developed a profiling system that is connected to the Single Sign-On (SSO) API. The profiling system serves as the data source of student information of the REST API. Besides, the portal and the REST API were utilized by various information systems such as ID Generation Management System (SIGS), Event Management System (EMS), Faculty Performance Evaluation System (FPES), and Smart Card-based attendance and monitoring.'
