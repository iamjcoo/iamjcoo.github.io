title: "Development of Electronic Business Permit and Licensing System (eBPLS)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ebpls
excerpt: 'E-government emerged as an important aspect in the delivery of public services. However, some local government e-services only offer interactive content such as application procedures and downloading of forms, and the process takes so long to complete. Hence, the main focus of the study is to develop a system, which will facilitate the application process of business permit and license into a streamlined electronic version using business permit and licensing system named eBPLS. This study adopted a modified Princeton Project Development Methodology (PPMP) as framework to structure the process of software development. The study used structured interview and survey questionnaires, which is designed in line with the ISO 9126 Software Quality Metrics, as data collection tools. In order to quantify the survey results the researchers used Five-Point likert scale and weighted mean to statistically analyze and interpret the general result. The survey focused on the perception of the respondents from the Business Permit Licensing Office of the two (2) municipalities in Camarines Sur, Philippines. Based on the findings, majority of the respondents perceived the proposed system as highly acceptable based on the average weighted mean of 4.61. Moreover, eBPLs was able to speed up the service delivery to one (1) day for both the new and renewal of business applications.'
