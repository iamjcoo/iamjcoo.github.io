collection: publications
permalink: /publication/irespond
excerpt: 'In the face of increasing natural disasters and emergencies, there is a growing need for effective geospatial information systems to process and classify emergency reports in real time. This work presents a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that is intended to classify emergency images taken and delivered to the iRESPOND system. Through the utilization of training phases and various tools, frameworks, and techniques, the authors effectively used deep learning to develop the CNN model. This model improves disaster response and mitigation by enabling the iRESPOND system to categorize emergency incidents rapidly. The results showcase the model’s commendable performance, achieving a high accuracy of 95.02% on the test set. A comprehensive evaluation, including precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for individual classes, illuminates the model’s strengths and areas for improvement. Noteworthy is the model’s proficiency in classes such as ‘flood’, ‘infrastructure_damage’, ‘no_damage_buildings_street’, ‘no_damage_ water_related’, and ‘no_damage_wildlife_forest’, reflecting robust predictive capabilities in specific emergency scenarios. The interpretability of the CNN model is augmented through visualization techniques like LIME, Grad-CAM, and Grad-CAM++. Also, a visualization report featuring the original image alongside interpretability overlays provides information on the characteristics and areas of the original images that influence the model’s decisions. In conclusion, the model demonstrates efficacy in rapidly categorizing emergency incidents, providing a valuable tool for the response team. The recommendations for future work underscore the continuous refinement required for optimal performance, including addressing class imbalances, fine-tuning hyperparameters, exploring ensemble models, and expanding the diverse image datasets.'
