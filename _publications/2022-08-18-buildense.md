title: "Exploring RAU-net for semantic segmentation of Philippines satellite images in identification of building density"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/buildense
excerpt: 'This study explores RAU-Net convolutional network architecture on satellite images by classifying geospatial objects on satellite images such as roofs to help in determining the building density of a specific location. This study developed a satellite image dataset in the Philippines and trained the dataset in an RAU-Net Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow Keras API. This study proves that U-Net works with a few datasets and provides acceptable performance scores. Furthermore, a new way to calculate Building Density in terms of Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) using satellite images was also presented in this study. The model and the analysis were integrated into an application that determines the BCR of a specific location through a satellite map.'

A fire incident is one of the most catastrophic calamity bringing injuries, loss of properties, and casualties. In the Philippines, a rapid increase in fire incidents was recorded from 2013 to 2016. In this paper, we explore the importance of data visualization and analysis in extracting useful information that might help in planning and decision-making. This study used the 2012–2016 Philippine Nationwide Fire Incident Statistics data provided by the Bureau of Fire Protection through Open Data Philippines. Data cleaning and reprocessing were conducted to develop a dynamic system known as FireStatPH using Flask. Different data visualization techniques such as choropleth map were also used in the study to represent each dataset. FireStatPH can easily identify the cities and municipalities with high fire incidents, injuries, deaths, and damages. It also provides fast statistics based on fire incident data. The system contributes to the planning and decision-making process in eschewing fire incidents in the Philippines.
